//Important notes// 
Package.json is configuration for npm
There are two types of Packages or dependecies that we can install. they are
a.Dev dependencies
b.Normal dependecies

//parcel
"parcel": "^2.12.0" ------> Here caret(^) means parcel will automatically upgrades to minor changes if comes in..
"parcel": "~2.12.0" ------> Here tilde(~) means parcel will automatically upgrades to major changes if comes in.

//package.json and packagelock.jsson
package.json: Describes your project and lists the dependencies you need.
package-lock.json: Locks the exact versions of those dependencies and their dependencies to ensure consistent installations. 

//node-modules
It's a collection lot of dependecies.
The node_modules directory is where all the dependencies (node modules) required by your project are stored. 
Each module may also have its own dependencies, which are stored in subdirectories within node_modules.

By using package.json and package-lock.json we can re install all node modules even though they are deleted.

//.gitignore file
In this file we can add the files which are not important for production.

npm || npx
npm is used to install packages like npm install 
npx is used to execute the package like npx parcel sourcefileName

CDN links
cdn links are not a preferable way to bring React and ReactDOM into our project. 

// Packages list and commands //

1. npm install -D parcel ------> where D means Dev environment parcel not normal parcel which is used in production.


// Production Built
when we are creating production built using parcel will get an error message. To avoid that we have to remove  main in package.json

// Extensions
